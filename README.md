# Image Classification using SVM
This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using classical machine learning techniques. It involves loading and preprocessing images, extracting features, and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize different classes.

🧰 Technologies Used • Python

• NumPy, Pandas

• OpenCV for image processing

• scikit-learn for machine learning (SVM, evaluation metrics)

• Matplotlib for visualization

• tqdm for progress tracking

🚀 Features • Load and preprocess image datasets

• Assign labels to images manually

• Split dataset into training and testing sets

• Train SVM classifier

Evaluate model using: • Accuracy

• Confusion Matrix

• Classification Report

📊 Results • The notebook concludes with evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and a confusion matrix to assess the model’s performance.
